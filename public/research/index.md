## Current Research

Presently, I research methods for improving the safety and specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology at the [Joung Lab](http://www.jounglab.org) (Massachusetts General Hospital).

I contributed to the development of GUIDE-seq, a method for detecting off-target cleavage events induced by genome editing nucleases. A core part of my work has been developing a [streamlined computational pipeline](https://github.com/aryeelab/guideseq) for easy analysis of GUIDE-seq data.

Later, I contributed to the engineering and characterization of Cas9 variants to expand the targeting range of the CRISPR-Cas toolbox. For my senior thesis, I am continuing to characterize Cas9 variants to expand the number of genomic locii that CRISPR-Cas can target.

To help scientists leverage the entire array of characterized Cas9 variants in their research, I created [CasBLASTR](http://casblastr.org/), a tool for identifying and annotating CRISPR-Cas target sites.


## Past Research

While in the [lab of Nobel Laureate Jack Szostak](http://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/) (Massachusetts General Hospital), I researched the processivity of RNA replication in the context of origins of life. We showed that a thio-substituted uridine enhances nonenzymatic RNA primer extension.

At the [Gunawardena Lab](http://vcp.med.harvard.edu/index.html) (Harvard Medical School) I studied redundancies in epigenetic marks around human promoter regions.

In high school, I worked on modeling the propagation of microwaves through human tissue at the [Popovic Lab](http://ecee.colorado.edu/microwave/group.html) (CU Boulder).
