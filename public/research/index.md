## Current Research

I currently work in the [Das Lab](https://daslab.stanford.edu) studying the structure of viral and eukaryotic RNA molecules.


## Past Research

### Genome Editing
At the [Joung Lab](http://www.jounglab.org) (Massachusetts General Hospital), I researched methods for improving the safety and specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology.

I contributed to the development of GUIDE-seq, a method for detecting off-target cleavage events induced by genome editing nucleases. A core part of my work was developing a [streamlined computational pipeline](https://github.com/aryeelab/guideseq) for easy analysis of GUIDE-seq data.

Later, I contributed to the engineering and characterization of Cas9 variants to expand the targeting range of the CRISPR-Cas toolbox. For my senior thesis, I characterized Cas9 orthologues to expand the number of genomic locii that the CRISPR-Cas system can target.

To help biologists leverage the entire array of characterized Cas9 variants in their research, I created [CasBLASTR](http://casblastr.org/), a tool for identifying and annotating CRISPR-Cas target sites.

### Origins of Life
While at the [Szostak Lab](http://molbio.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/) (Massachusetts General Hospital), I researched the processivity of RNA polymerase ribozymes from an origins of life perspective.


### Epigenomics
At the [Gunawardena Lab](http://vcp.med.harvard.edu/index.html) (Harvard Medical School) I studied redundancies in epigenetic marks around human gene promoter regions.

### Human Tissue Properties
In high school, I worked on modeling the propagation of microwaves through human tissue at the [Popovic Lab](http://ecee.colorado.edu/microwave/group.html) (CU Boulder).
