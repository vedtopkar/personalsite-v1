# My thoughts on Star Wars: Rogue One

After some delay, I finally had the chance to watch the new Star Wars movie. As background, I've been a strong Star Wars fanboy for quite some time, and have been generally supportive of all of the movies (including the prequels, though don't get me started on the first 80% of Episode I). Barring a few small nitpicks, I found the film incredibly enjoyable, a great throwback to the original trilogy, and a productive contribution to the Star Wars universe overall.

It should go without saying: **Spoilers Ahead**

## The moral gray zone

- Cassian killing civilians, other bad things. Rebellions are hard. Things aren't black and white. Glad that was shown

## World-building

The best part of the movie, in my opinion, was excellent world-building.

- Jedi Temple, Kyber crystal. 

## Some editing nitpicks

As stated earlier, there were a few places where I was taken out of the movie â€“ places where small changes could have drastically improved the overall finish of the film.

1. **Sound editing for Bodhi Rook**, the defected Imperial cargo pilot who delivered to Jyn Erso a hologram from her father, was a bit off. The character had a number of crucial roles that pushed the plot forward, but inconsistent sound editing for his voice was very distracting. Sometimes, he was far too quiet compared to other characters, sometimes he was just right. The actor (the breakout Riz Ahmed) was certainly not at fault, as he did a great job of taking on his given role. Rather, rushed editing for last-minute reshoots that the actor recently discussed on the talk show circuit may be to blame. Regardless, this will hopefully be fixed by the time the movie is released digitally.

2. **Leia's CGI face** was... ok. Don't get me wrong, her inclusion at the end of the film was amazing and unexpected, but the way that her face was constructed was slightly off-putting. Contrast this against the CGI face of Grand Moff Tarkin, which was very realistic, especially in its movement. The prevailing theory is that highly detailed faces are seen as more realistic, and with the older Peter Cushing as source material, Tarkin's face was more believable with its numerous wrinkles, spots, lines, and depressions. Leia's face, however, was shown as too young and flawless, which likely contributed to the feeling of it being too artificial when animated. The details of a young Carrie Fisher's face are far more subtles (some small freckles and the like), which (at least upon my inspection) were not carried over to the CGI Leia face, perhaps to make her look slightly younger than her appearance in the original trilogy. While this decision makes storytelling sense, perhaps some creative license should have been employed.

3. **Those droids**, as in, R2-D2 and C3PO were included out of necessity to make sure that casual viewers really got
