For the first time in a few years, I have fully rewritten my personal website in hopes of better organizing and outwardly portraying my own history and future endeavors.

This site is built using the [Harp.js](http://www.harpjs.com) static site generator along with [EJS](https://github.com/tj/ejs) templating and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets.
