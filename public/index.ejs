<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>I'm Ved Topkar, a first year MD/PhD student at Stanford Medical School. I graduated from Harvard College with a major in Chemical and Physical Biology and a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in biomedical research, entrepreneurship, and computer science education.</p>

<p>On the side, I am involved in <a href="http://beacongenomics.com">Beacon Genomics</a>, a genome editing specificity and safety company spun out of the <a href="http://jounglab.org">Joung Lab</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have dabbled in a number research projects. A summary of my current and past research experiences can be found <a href="/research">here</a>, and information about the published papers that I have coauthored can be found <a href="/publications">here</a>.</p>

<p>I previously co-founded and co-exited the education technology company <a href="http://keystone.education">Keystone Learning Systems</a>. A writeup of our story from founding to acquisition can be found <a href="https://medium.com/startup-secrets/send-off-announcement-exiting-our-tech-startup-66e865871ec3">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in chatting, connecting, or collaborating, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
